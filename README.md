CodingBat is a free site of live Java and Python coding problems to build coding skill. 
Each problem has a problem description and a table showing some sample output for that problem. 

According to Nick, 

  "The problems in each section get harder towards the end of the section. 

  Every big programming problem has a lot of little programming problems in it. The little programming problems have elements we see again 
  and again -- string and list manipulation, loops, a little logic.

  Working with students in office hours, I see what a big advantage it is for students who are practiced and quick with these little bits 
  of code. 
  Skill with the little code allows students to concentrate on the larger parts of the problem. Or put another other way, someone who 
  struggles with the loops, logic, etc. does not have time for the big picture.

  CodingBat is all about building and practicing little code problems. 
  The number of problems in each area is pretty large, so you can repeat and solidify your code skill in that area."
